# Spoiler Alert

These unit tests contain the puzzle answers. **If you do not want to see the
answers, do not look at the unit tests.** Also, do not assume that these answers
will work for you. Advent of Code assigns input data for each puzzle to each
user from a pool of input data. The data is not unique for **every** user,
but there are multiple data sets for each puzzle.
